	i.e. instead of from ..formula import calculate_mass , we write from ..formula.calculate_mass import calculate_mass
- kendrick mass defect now takes string (as opposed to list) for atom_group
- no more *msTuple as a function input, replaced by msTuple_list, which is clearer and cleaner to work with
- read_batch_formularity now results in an msTuple dictionary instead of a formulaDf
- corems, upsetplot, pca and user guide notebooks to reflect 1.2.0 changes

### Deleted
- standardize_formula function as it wasn't used
- unique_formula and missing_formula, as their functionality is just a part of find_intersections and the input syntax was confusing
- unique_plot and missing_plot as they are a type of multi_van_krevelen_plot and the syntax was confusing

### Added
- Added __version__ to root directory init.py
- Added read_corems.py function to pykrev/formula 
- Added corems_with_pykrev user guide

### Changed
- kendrick_mass_defect doesn't require a formula list anymore 
- added two extra rounding methods for calculating nominal mass in kendrick mass defect. 
	'floor' - always round down to nearest integer, and 'ceil' always round up to nearest integer. 
- renamed the integer rounding method in kendrick mass defect from 'integer' to 'rint' to avoid confusion.
- removed requirement for formula list from kendrick mass defect plot
- made changes to tests to reflect this

- monoisotopic masses now allows you to calculate the mass of charged ions and deprotonated ions
- updated the user guide to show how mass error can be calculated using calculate mass
- read_formularity now only returns formula, intensity and mass .Note all functions should input/return in this order.

## [1.0.2] -03-02-2021
