	Docstring for function pyKrev.compound_class
	====================
	This function takes an msTuple and calculates compound class categories based on the method give in method. 
    
	Use
	----
	compound_class(Y)
    
	Returns two items. The first is a list of len(Y[0]) in which each item is the compound class associated with the ith element of Y[0]. 
    The second is a dictionary containing the compound class counts. 
    
	Parameters
	----------
	Y: msTuple 
        
	method: String, the method to use, one of:
