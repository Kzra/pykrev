	Docstring for function PyKrev.read_batch_formularity
	====================
	This function reads in data from the report csv file produced by formularity software when performing batch assignment with alignment.
	The function filters out any formula that do not have C and H atoms.
    
	Use
	----
	read_batch_formularity(report_name)
    
	Returns a dataframe with the formula strings, masses, compound classes and mass errors of the overall alignment and their corresponding peak 
    intensities in each spectra, and an ordination matrix of type pd.Dataframe with formula strings as column headers and spectra as rows (see 
    pk.ordination_matrix) (optional) 
    
	Parameters
	----------
	report_name: name of csv file that the formularity report to be read is saved as. 
	impute_value: value to impute for 0 peak intensities in the output ordination matrix (default 0), see pk.Ordination_matrix)
    ordination: boolean, compute an ordination matrix using pk.ordination_matrix?
    
    Note: PyKrev will filter out formula with 13C assignments
