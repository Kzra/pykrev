	====================
	This function takes an msTuple and returns atomic ratios of each ratio given in ratios for each formula in the formula list.
    
	Use
	----
	element_ratios(Y)
    
	Returns a list of len(Y) in which each item is a dictionary containing the atomic ratios listed in ratios, 
	calculated as the first element / second element. If the second element is zero, a nan or zero value is returned
    depending on zero_ratio.

	----------
	Y: msTuple OR a list of molecular formula strings
    
	ratios: list, atomic ratios to compute, calculated as first element divided by second element.
