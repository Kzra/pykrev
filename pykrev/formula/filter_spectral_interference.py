	Docstring for function pykrev.filter_spectral_interference
	====================
	This function takes a list or numpy array of masses and a corresponding list of formula strings 
    and a corresponding list or numpy array of peak intensities
    and returns filtered copies of all arrays with suspected 
    spectral interferences due to high molecular weight doubly charged ions, removed.
    
	Use
	----
	filter_spectral_interference(Y,X,Z)
    
	Returns a tuple containing an array of len(Y[filter]) in which each item is the filtered mass, and a list of len(Y[filter]) in which each item 
    is the filtered formula and an array of len(Y[filter]) in which each item is a filtered peak_intensity. 
    
	Parameters
	----------
	Z: A list or numpy array of masses.
    Y: A list of molecular formula strings.
    X: A list or numpy array of peak intensities.
    tol: Integer of float,the tolerance (in ppm) used to identify monoisotopic 
    verbose: Booloean, print text to the console.
    
    Note: for more information on this algorithm please refer to Patriarca, Claudia, and Jeffrey A. Hawkes.
